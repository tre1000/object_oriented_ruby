Use hashes with symbols to represent the following scenario:
 You are the owner of a store that sells items (you decide what specifically). Each item has various properties such as color, price, etc.
Represent 3 items using hashes. Each hash should have the same keys with different values.
Be sure to use symbols for the keys. Try creating hashes using both types of hash symbol syntaxes. (Ruby syntax {:a => 123} vs. “JavaScript” syntax {a: 123}).
